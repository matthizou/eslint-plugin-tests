# descriptions-in-tests

## Intro

In tests, `it` functions are, by convention, often used like that:

```
it('returns the expected result', () => {
 .....
})
```

The first word of the description ("returns" in here) is a verb conjugated with
"it".

It is quite frequent to see developers forgetting about that, yet it is simple
to check.

That's what this little rule does. Just check the first word, nothing less,
nothing more.

---

## Options

- `noVagueVerbs` _[Boolean] Optional_  
  Default: **false**

  Whether the descriptions can start with verbs indicating a probability, such
  as "should", "could", "may".

---

## Rules

- The description shouldn't be empty

- The first word of the description should start with a lower-case letter

- The first word must be conjugated with "it".  
  This rule can recognize the most often used verbs and whether they are
  conjugated or not.

```js
// ️✔ Good
it('does nothing', () => {})

// Bad - not conjugated
it('do nothing', () => {})

// Bad - capitalized
it('Does nothing', () => {})

// Bad - empty
it('', () => {})

// Bad with option `noVagueVerbs` set to `true`
it('should do nothing but I am not 100% sure', () => {})
```

## Notes

- Only descriptions of `it` functions are considered

- 🛠️ This rule has auto-fix for 100% of the issues it reports 🎉  
  Run eslint with the `--fix` or `--fix-dry-run` option

- 📗 This rule works with a small inner English dictionnary of the most common
  verbs starting descripitions. It would be easy extend it/make it customizable
  with a new option. That would additionally give i18n support. Let me know if
  you need it ! 💬
